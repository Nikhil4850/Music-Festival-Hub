# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
1. A Vercel account
2. A GitHub account
3. This project with fixed dependencies

## Steps to Deploy to Vercel

### 1. Prepare Your Project
Make sure you've run the dependency fix script:
```bash
node fix-dependencies.js
```

This ensures your [package.json](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/package.json) and package-lock.json files are in sync.

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dependencies for Vercel deployment"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Root Directory: Leave empty
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: Leave empty
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### 5. Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
- `NODE_ENV`: production

Note: For a full application with backend functionality, you'll need to deploy your backend separately since Vercel is primarily for frontend applications.

## Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment Issues

### Dependency Issues (Fixed)
If you see errors like:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync
```

Run the fix script:
```bash
node fix-dependencies.js
```

### Build Issues
If you encounter build errors:

1. Check that your [vercel.json](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/vercel.json) file is properly configured
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in [package.json](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/package.json)
3. Verify that your [server.js](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/server.js) file is properly configured for Vercel

### Common Solutions

1. **Clear Vercel Cache**: In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings and click "Clean Cache & Deploy"

2. **Check Logs**: Vercel provides detailed build logs that can help identify specific issues

3. **Verify Node.js Version**: Make sure your local Node.js version is compatible with Vercel's build environment

## Alternative Deployment Options

Since this is a full-stack application with both frontend and backend, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Railway/Render
1. Deploy the frontend files to Vercel
2. Deploy the backend directory to Railway or Render
3. Update API URLs in your frontend JavaScript files

### Option 2: Deploy Everything to Render
Render supports both static sites and Node.js servers in a single project.

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. Update API endpoints in your frontend JavaScript files to point to your deployed backend
2. Test all functionality including user registration, login, and event booking
3. Monitor the deployment for any issues

## Support

If you continue to have issues with Vercel deployment:

1. Check the Vercel documentation: [https://vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
2. Review the build logs in your Vercel dashboard
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in [package.json](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/package.json)
