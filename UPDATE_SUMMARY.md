# Music Festival Hub - Application Update Summary

This document summarizes all the updates made to configure the Music Festival Hub application to work with MongoDB Atlas.

## 1. Backend Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
- Updated [MONGODB_URI](file:///C:/Users/Nikhil/Videos/f/web%20-%20Copy/backend/.env#L3-L3) to use MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Updated JWT_SECRET to a more secure value
- Verified all other environment variables are properly configured

### Server Configuration (backend/server.js)
- Verified MongoDB connection uses environment variables
- Added debug logging to verify environment variable loading
- Confirmed server starts on port 5000

### Package Dependencies (backend/package.json)
- Verified all required dependencies are listed
- Confirmed nodemon is included for development

## 2. Frontend Configuration

### API Service (api-service.js)
- Updated baseUrl to connect to backend on http://localhost:5000/api
- Disabled mock data mode for development
- Ensured token management works correctly

### Frontend Server (server.js)
- Changed port from 3000 to 3001 to avoid conflict with backend
- Updated console logging to reflect new port

## 3. Scripts and Automation

### Batch Files
- Updated start-backend.bat with clearer instructions
- Updated start-server.bat with correct port information
- Created restart-backend.bat to handle port conflicts

### Package Scripts (package.json)
- Added concurrently dependency for running both frontend and backend
- Added dev:frontend, dev:backend, and dev scripts
- Verified all scripts work correctly

## 4. Documentation

### README Files
- Created comprehensive README.md for the entire project
- Updated backend README.md with MongoDB Atlas setup instructions
- Added clear setup and deployment instructions

## 5. Database

### MongoDB Atlas
- Confirmed connection string is properly configured
- Verified backend successfully connects to MongoDB Atlas
- Tested database operations work correctly

## 6. Security

### JWT Configuration
- Updated JWT secret to a more secure value
- Verified token generation and validation works
- Confirmed password hashing with bcrypt

## 7. Testing

### Connection Verification
- Verified frontend can communicate with backend
- Confirmed backend connects to MongoDB Atlas
- Tested API endpoints work correctly

## 8. Deployment Preparation

### Production Readiness
- Configured environment variables for different environments
- Added proper error handling
- Verified CORS configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Run `npm run dev` from the root directory to start both frontend and backend
   - Or run batch files individually:
     - start-backend.bat for backend
     - start-server.bat for frontend

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000/api

3. **Test Functionality**:
   - Register a new user
   - Login with the user
   - Browse events
   - Create a booking

4. **Verify Database Operations**:
   - Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard to see data being stored
   - Verify user registrations appear in the database
   - Confirm bookings are saved correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Use restart-backend.bat to kill any processes on port 5000
   - Check that no other applications are using ports 3001 or 5000

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string in .env file
   - Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
   - Check that database user credentials are correct

3. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is set in .env file
   - Check that tokens are being sent with API requests
   - Ensure bcrypt is properly hashing passwords

4. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Verify api-service.js is configured to use http://localhost:5000/api
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

The application is now fully configured to work with your MongoDB Atlas database and ready for development and testing.
